## Is the AI Track right for me?

Hi! Welcome to our small self-evaluation of your Data Science skills. Since you want to join the AI Track you should have some prior coding experience, for example by taking the Data Science track in the last semester or using Pandas/Numpy/Matplotlib in your studies or Hiwi-Job.

If you never ever heard of Pandas/Numpy/Matplotlib you probably already can stop reading right here - the Data Science track might be just right to start! 

The notebook won't be evaluated, we even won't see it at all. If you want to cheat - we cannot hinder you, but we also can't help you changing tracks after the semester started. Be honest to yourself, it's totally fine to start with the basics :) 

That's it with the trivia. We did the notebook ourselfes and needed ~30 minutes to solve it, just to give you a rough estimate. Enjoy! 😊
